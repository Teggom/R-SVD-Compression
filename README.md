# R-SVD-Compression
After learning about matrix SVD Decomposition in a math class, I wanted to try it out myself in R
This was just my attempt to do various things and see the results. 

A picture set has been included as an example. 

Some of this "General_Scrips.R" I cant remember what they do, it was a long time ago.
